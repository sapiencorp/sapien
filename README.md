## Overview

**Artificial Sapien** allows users to create their own AI agents, named "sapien", to automate various tasks on the Solana blockchain:

- **Automated Trading**
- **Wallet Management**
- **Asset Tracking**

These agents are powered by our native token **$sapien**, which is used for transaction fees, agent deployment, and community governance.

## Features

- **Customizable AI Agents:** Design your own AI agents with specific tasks tailored to your needs.
- **Solana Integration:** Seamless interaction with the Solana blockchain for real-time data and transaction execution.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Understand and interact with blockchain data through natural language queries.
- **Analyzation Tools:** Deep dive into blockchain analytics for informed decision-making.
